rooms:

  lobby:
    name: "The Shattered Lobby"
    sanctuary: true
    description: |
      You stand in a broad stone hall hung with torn banners.
      The air hums faintly, as if the world itself is still booting up.
      Symbols shimmer faintly along the walls—half runes, half code.
      A dim archway leads deeper into the forming world.

    brief: "A stone hall filled with humming creation-energy."
    exits:
      east: antechamber

  antechamber:
    name: "Dusty Antechamber"
    description: |
      This cramped chamber smells of dust and old secrets.
      Faded chalk marks scar the floor in shapes of half-remembered circles.
      Scribbled diagrams hint at old rituals—or early development notes.
      The lobby lies back to the west.

    brief: "A cramped antechamber coated in dust and forgotten chalk."
    exits:
      west: lobby
      south: scriptorium

  scriptorium:
    name: "Scriptorium of Echoing Ink"
    description: |
      Tall shelves bow under the weight of cracked tomes.
      Quills drift lazily through the air, writing messages you can't quite read.
      A soft scratching sound echoes with no visible source.
      A stairway descends to the Archive Vault, and a corridor leads east.

    brief: "A quiet study chamber filled with drifting quills."
    exits:
      north: antechamber
      east: archive_hall
      down: archive_vault

  archive_hall:
    name: "Hall of Fragmented Archives"
    description: |
      Rows of crystalline data-shards hover in midair, flickering with memories.
      Touching one sends ripples of light racing across the hall.
      Some shards pulse steadily; others flicker like corrupted files.
      A passage returns west to the Scriptorium, and a ramp slopes southward.

    brief: "A hall of floating memory-shards."
    exits:
      west: scriptorium
      south: sanctum_gate

  sanctum_gate:
    name: "Gate of the Inner Sanctum"
    description: |
      A towering circular door of stone and polished bone stands before you.
      Its surface glows with shifting sigils that feel almost alive.
      You sense safety beyond this threshold, as if a powerful peace dwells there.
      The Archive Hall lies to the north; the gate hints at a deeper world beyond.

    brief: "A glowing circular gate humming with quiet power."
    exits:
      north: archive_hall
      south: dustworn_crossroads

  archive_vault:
    name: "Archive Vault"
    description: |
      You descend into a chamber carved directly into the bedrock.
      Heavy iron shelves line the walls, their contents wrapped in chains and seals.
      The air is thicker here, as if sound itself moves reluctantly.
      A narrow staircase leads back up to the Scriptorium.

    brief: "A deep vault of chained and sealed archives."
    exits:
      up: scriptorium

  dustworn_crossroads:
    name: "Dustworn Crossroads"
    description: |
      A battered wooden signpost stands at the heart of the crossroads, its arrows faded by sun and time.
      Dust devils twist lazily across the cracked earth, each one whispering hints of lost voices.
      Tracks lead in every direction—bootprints, hooves, and shapes you’d rather not identify.
      Behind you, the strange glow of the Inner Sanctum flickers faintly through the dust-haze.

    brief: "A weather-beaten crossroads carved by countless travelers."
    exits:
      north: sanctum_gate
      south: old_well

  old_well:
    name: "The Old Well"
    description: |
      A stone well rises from the ground like the spine of some buried giant.
      A frayed rope dangles into the darkness, swaying even without wind.
      Someone—or something—has carved tally marks into the stones.
      Faint echoes drift up from below, half water, half whispers.

    brief: "A lonely stone well with an unsettling air."
    exits:
      north: dustworn_crossroads
      south: frontier_saloon

  frontier_saloon:
    name: "Frontier Saloon"
    description: |
      Warm lantern light spills through slatted windows, illuminating dust motes like drifting fireflies.
      The bar counter is carved with runes and old knife marks.
      A player piano in the corner wheezes out the broken remains of a tune, stopping whenever you look at it.
      Empty chairs sit as if waiting for a crowd that never quite arrives.

    brief: "A dim saloon warmed by lantern glow and bad decisions."
    exits:
      north: old_well
      east: sheriffs_office
      south: boot_hill

  sheriffs_office:
    name: "Sheriff’s Office"
    description: |
      The sheriff’s desk is buried under wanted posters—some human, some definitely not.
      A single barred cell sits in the back, its door slightly ajar.
      A badge hangs on a nail, tarnished but still proud.
      A chalkboard on the wall lists names and debts, many smudged away.

    brief: "A cluttered office filled with law… or what's left of it."
    exits:
      west: frontier_saloon

  boot_hill:
    name: "Boot Hill"
    description: |
      Rough wooden grave markers jut from the dry ground at odd angles.
      Wind whistles through their cracks, producing a mournful, almost musical howl.
      Fresh tracks—clawed and bipedal—circle one grave in particular.
      A few markers have symbols instead of names, as if the dead defied being written down.

    brief: "A lonely hill dotted with forgotten graves."
    exits:
      north: frontier_saloon
      east: coyote_ridge
      south: drywind_gate

  coyote_ridge:
    name: "Coyote Ridge"
    description: |
      The ridge overlooks miles of shimmering desert.
      Strange coyotes made of smoke dart between the rocks, leaving trails that fade instantly.
      A single thorn tree stands defiantly at the peak, its branches hung with small bone totems.
      Every now and then, a distant howl glitches into something almost like static.

    brief: "A rocky ridge haunted by smoky coyotes."
    exits:
      west: boot_hill

  drywind_gate:
    name: "Drywind Gate"
    description: |
      Twin stone pillars flank a rusted iron gate, its hinges groaning with the weight of centuries.
      Beyond lies only heat-haze and the promise of danger.
      Someone has painted the words “TURN BACK FOOL” in flaking red letters.
      A cold gust squeezes through the bars, carrying the scent of storms and gunpowder.

    brief: "A crumbling gate marking the edge of the known frontier."
    exits:
      north: boot_hill
