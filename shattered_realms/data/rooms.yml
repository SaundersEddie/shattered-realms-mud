rooms:

  lobby:
    name: "The Shattered Lobby"
    sanctuary: true
    description: |
      You stand in a broad stone hall hung with torn banners.
      The air hums faintly, as if the world itself is still booting up.
      Symbols shimmer faintly along the walls—half runes, half code.
      A dim archway leads deeper into the forming world.

    brief: "A stone hall filled with humming creation-energy."
    exits:
      east: antechamber

  antechamber:
    name: "Dusty Antechamber"
    description: |
      This cramped chamber smells of dust and old secrets.
      Faded chalk marks scar the floor in shapes of half-remembered circles.
      Scribbled diagrams hint at old rituals—or early development notes.
      The lobby lies back to the west.

    brief: "A cramped antechamber coated in dust and forgotten chalk."
    exits:
      west: lobby
      south: scriptorium

  scriptorium:
    name: "Scriptorium of Echoing Ink"
    description: |
      Tall shelves bow under the weight of cracked tomes.
      Quills drift lazily through the air, writing messages you can't quite read.
      A soft scratching sound echoes with no visible source.
      A stairway descends to the Archive Vault, and a corridor leads east.

    brief: "A quiet study chamber filled with drifting quills."
    exits:
      north: antechamber
      east: archive_hall
      down: archive_vault

  archive_hall:
    name: "Hall of Fragmented Archives"
    description: |
      Rows of crystalline data-shards hover in midair, flickering with memories.
      Touching one sends ripples of light racing across the hall.
      Some shards pulse steadily; others flicker like corrupted files.
      A passage returns west to the Scriptorium, and a ramp slopes southward.

    brief: "A hall of floating memory-shards."
    exits:
      west: scriptorium
      south: sanctum_gate

  sanctum_gate:
    name: "Gate of the Inner Sanctum"
    description: |
      A towering circular door of stone and polished bone stands before you.
      Its surface glows with shifting sigils that feel almost alive.
      You sense safety beyond this threshold, as if a powerful peace dwells there.
      The Archive Hall lies to the north; the gate hints at a deeper world beyond.

    brief: "A glowing circular gate humming with quiet power."
    exits:
      north: archive_hall

  archive_vault:
    name: "Archive Vault"
    description: |
      You descend into a chamber carved directly into the bedrock.
      Heavy iron shelves line the walls, their contents wrapped in chains and seals.
      The air is thicker here, as if sound itself moves reluctantly.
      A narrow staircase leads back up to the Scriptorium.

    brief: "A deep vault of chained and sealed archives."
    exits:
      up: scriptorium
