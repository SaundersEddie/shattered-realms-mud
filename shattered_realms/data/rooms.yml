    name: "The Shattered Lobby"
    description: |
      You stand in a broad stone hall hung with torn banners.
      The air hums faintly, as if the world itself is still booting up.
      A dim archway leads into deeper darkness.

    brief: "A rough stone hall filled with the echoes of creation."
    exits:
      east: antechamber

  antechamber:
    name: "Dusty Antechamber"
    description: |
      This cramped chamber smells of dust and old secrets.
      Faded chalk marks scar the floor in the shapes of long-forgotten circles.
      The lobby lies back to the west.

    brief: "A cramped, dust-choked antechamber."
    exits:
